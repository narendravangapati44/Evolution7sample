Zomato API documentation can be found from => https://developers.zomato.com/documentation

For this demo project, '/search' API is used, which requires just the Melbourne's ID to satisfy the search requirements of the project. 
Melbourne's ID is hardcoded into the script (It can also be dynamically generated from '/cities' API)



----------------zom.php-------------------------
The zom.php file contains php code to use Zomato's API to fetch and display upto 20 restaurents in Melbourne's CBD.
